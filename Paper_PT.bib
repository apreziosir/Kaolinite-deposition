abstract = {Characterizing the collective behavior of particle transport on the Earth surface is a key ingredient in describing landscape evolution. We seek equations that capture essential features of transport of an ensemble of particles on hillslopes, valleys, river channels, or river networks, such as mass conservation, superdiffusive spreading in flow fields with large velocity variation, or retardation due to particle trapping. Development of stochastic partial differential equations such as the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) begins with assumptions about the random behavior of a single particle: possible velocities it may experience in a flow field and the length of time it may be immobilized. When assumptions underlying the ADE are relaxed, a fractional ADE (fADE) can arise, with a non-integer-order derivative on time or space terms. Fractional ADEs are nonlocal; they describe transport affected by hydraulic conditions at a distance. Space fractional ADEs arise when velocity variations are heavy tailed and describe particle motion that accounts for variation in the flow field over the entire system. Time fractional ADEs arise as a result of power law particle residence time distributions and describe particle motion with memory in time. Here we present a phenomenological discussion of how particle transport behavior may be parsimoniously described by a fADE, consistent with evidence of superdiffusive and subdiffusive behavior in natural and experimental systems.},

abstract = {Biogeochemical and ecological transformations in hyporheic zones are dependent on the timing of hyporheic exchange. We show through linked modeling of open channel turbulent flow, groundwater flow, and solute transport that the residence time distributions of solutes advected by hyporheic flow induced by current-bedform interaction follow power-laws. This tailing behavior of solutes exiting the sediments is explained by the presence of multiple path lengths coupled with very large variability in Darcy flow velocity, both occurring without heterogeneity in sediment permeability. Hyporheic exchange through bedforms will result in short-time fractal scaling of stream water chemistry. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Packman2000b,
abstract = {Experiments were conducted in a recirculating flume to elucidate the fundamental physical and chemical processes which control the stream-subsurface exchange of colloids. Results are presented on the rate of exchange of colloids (kaolinite clay) and a conservative solute (lithium) from a stream to a sand streambed covered by stationary bed forms (dunes, ripples). Kaolinite and lithium were added to the recirculating stream, and their exchange with the bed was observed over time. Kaolinite was observed to be much more extensively trapped in the streambed than lithium owing to nonconservative processes. By the end of most experiments, essentially all added kaolinite was taken up by the streambed. The observed exchange rates can be explained by analyzing the solute and particle fluxes through the stream-subsurface interface and the physicochemical interactions between transported kaolinite and the bed sediment. The colloid pumping model predicts particle exchange based on pumping hydraulics, particle settling in the bed, and filtration by the bed sediments. Observed colloid and solute exchanges were successfully predicted by the process-based models without the use of fitting coefficients. Hydraulic parameters measured in the flume and particle parameters measured in separate experiments were used as model inputs. The successful prediction of experimental results validates the modeling approach of combining a fundamental hydraulic exchange model with a physicochemical model for colloid transport and filtration in the streambed. Further, because colloid transport behavior was interpreted in terms of basic exchange and trapping processes, the results of this study are expected to be directly applicable to the analysis of fine sediment dynamics in natural streams.},

abstract = {Long-term survival of pathogenic microorganisms in streams enables long-distance disease transmission. In order to manage water-borne diseases more effectively we need to better predict how microbes behave in freshwater systems, particularly how they are transported downstream in rivers. Microbes continuously immobilize and resuspend during downstream transport owing to a variety of processes including gravitational settling, attachment to in-stream structures such as submerged macrophytes, and hyporheic exchange and filtration within underlying sediments. We developed a stochastic model to describe these microbial transport and retention processes in rivers that also accounts for microbial inactivation. We used the model to assess the transport, retention, and inactivation of Escherichia coli in a small stream and the underlying streambed sediments as measured from multitracer injection experiments. The results demonstrate that the combination of laboratory experiments on sediment cores, stream reach-scale tracer experiments, and multiscale stochastic modeling improves assessment of microbial transport in streams. This study (1) demonstrates new observations of microbial dynamics in streams with improved data quality than prior studies, (2) advances a stochastic modeling framework to include microbial inactivation processes that we observed to be important in these streams, and (3) synthesizes new and existing data to evaluate seasonal dynamics.},

abstract = {The transport of solutes in rivers is influenced by the exchange of water between the river and the underlying hyporheic zone. The residence times of solutes in the hyporheic zone are typically much longer than traveltimes in the stream, resulting in a significant delay in the downstream propagation of solutes. A new model for this process is proposed here on the basis of the continuous time random walk (CTRW) approach. The CTRW is a generalization of the classic random walk that can include arbitrary distributions of waiting times, and it is particularly suited to deal with the long residence times arising from hyporheic exchange. Inclusion of suitable hyporheic residence time distributions in the CTRW leads to a generalized advection-dispersion equation for instream concentration breakthrough curves that includes the effects of specific hyporheic exchange processes. Here examples are presented for advective hyporheic exchange resulting from regular and irregular series of bedforms. A second major advantage of the CTRW approach is that the combined effects of different processes affecting overall downstream transport can be incorporated in the model by convolving separate waiting time distributions for each relevant process. The utility of this approach is illustrated by analyzing the effects of local-scale sediment heterogeneity on bedform-induced hyporheic exchange. The ability to handle arbitrarily wide residence time distributions and the ability to assess the combined effects of multiple transport processes makes the CTRW model framework very useful for the study of solute transport problems in rivers. The model presented here can be easily extended to represent different types of surface-subsurface exchange processes and the transport of both conservative and nonconservative substances in rivers.

abstract = {Both microbial metabolism and pathogen retention and remobilization are dependent on downstream transport of fine particles, which migrate in a series of deposition and resuspension events. All fine particles, including clay minerals, particulate organic carbon, nutrients and microbes, are often considered to be transported similarly in the environment because of a lack of specific observations comparing their relative transport. We conducted a tracer injection study to compare the transport and retention of the fecal indicator bacterium Escherichia coli, synthetic inert fluorescent fine particles, and a dissolved conservative tracer. We found that the fluorescent fine particles and bacteria were transported similarly, with both having greater retention than the solute tracer. We used a stochastic model to evaluate in-stream retention and migration of the solute, fluorescent particles, and E. coli. The best-fit model parameters indicate that different stream reaches had varied retention characteristics, but always showed greater retention of fluorescent particles and E. coli compared to the solute tracer. Direct measurements within known retention areas after the injection showed that the majority of the fluorescent particles and E. coli were retained near the sediment-water interface in macrophyte stands or filtered within the top 3cm of the streambed sediment. Both the tracer particles and E. coli were retained within these regions for multiple months following the injection experiment. The stochastic model properly captured the wide range of storage timescales and processes we observed in the stream. Our results demonstrate the importance of the streambed sediment and in-stream macrophytes as short- and long-term reservoirs for fine organic particles and microbes in streams.},
